DevOps:
------

Can you tell us the fundamental differences between DevOps & Agile?

Ans: 
DevOps is a practice of bringing development and operations teams together whereas Agile is an iterative approach that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback and small rapid releases.
DevOps focuses on constant testing and delivery while the Agile process focuses on constant changes.
DevOps requires relatively a large team while Agile requires a small team.
DevOps leverages both shifts left and right principles, on the other hand, Agile leverage shift-left principle.
The target area of Agile is Software development whereas the Target area of DevOps is to give end-to-end business solutions and fast delivery.
DevOps focuses more on operational and business readiness whereas Agile focuses on functional and non-function readiness.

Ping is a simple command that can test the reachability of a device on the network. 
Traceroute is a command you use to 'trace' the route that a packet takes when traveling to its destination. 
It's useful for tracing network problems, discovering where connections fail, and tracking down latency problems.

Q3) I type http://www.yahoo.com in my browser's URL bar and I press enter. What happens ? (discuss at every OSI layer - Physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, application) DNS & anycast, IP, UDP, routing, BGP, TCP, HTTP, transparent proxy
Ans:
1: Physical layer --- The Physical Layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals.

2: Data link layer --- The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices.

3: Network layer --- The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in "different networks".

4: Transport layer --- The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions. Transport protocols may be connection-oriented or connectionless.

5: Session layer --- The Session Layer creates the setup, controls the connections, and ends the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a "session". 

6: Presentation layer --- The Presentation Layer establishes data formatting and data translation into a format specified by the application layer during the encapsulation of outgoing messages while being passed down the protocol stack, and possibly reversed during the deencapsulation of incoming messages when being passed up the protocol stack.

7: Application layer --- The application layer is the layer of the OSI model that is closest to the end user, which means both the OSI Application Layer and the user interact directly with software application that implements a component of communication between the client and server, such as File Explorer and Microsoft Word.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model

DNS & anycast --- Anycast DNS means that any one of a number of DNS servers can respond to DNS queries, and typically the one that is geographically closest will provide the response.

IP --- IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

UDP --- The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a lightweight data transport protocol that works on top of IP. UDP provides a mechanism to detect corrupt data in packets, but it does not attempt to solve other problems that arise with packets, such as lost or out of order packets.

Routing --- Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. 

TCP --- TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network.

HTTP --- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.

Transparent proxy --- A transparent proxy, also known as an inline proxy, intercepting proxy or forced proxy, is a server that intercepts the connection between an end-user or device and the internet.

Q4) What is BGP?
Ans:
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) refers to a gateway protocol that enables the internet to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS). As networks interact with each other, they need a way to communicate. This is accomplished through peering.

Q5) What's a PTR in DNS? Why should we care?
Ans:
The Domain Name System, or DNS, correlates domain names with IP addresses. A DNS pointer record (PTR for short) provides the domain name associated with an IP address. A DNS PTR record is exactly the opposite of the 'A' record, which provides the IP address associated with a domain name.

Q6) What if I change from http://www.yahoo.com to https://www.yahoo.com ?
Ans:
If change like above and first url not secure one and second url have secure one, Public/private certificates, CAs, proxying, MiTM, etc.

DNAT transforms the destination address of packets passing through the Router. SNAT is implemented after the routing decision is built. DNAT is implemented before the routing decision is built. SNAT allows multiple hosts on the “internal” to receive to any host on the “external”.

Q11) What is a virtual IP address? What is a cluster?
Ans:
Virtual IP Address of an Active/Passive Cluster. A virtual IP address is like any other IP address except it does not have a specific host or node to resolve to. It resolves at run time to a server wherever the IP is physically bound and reachable on the network.


Security:

Q1) What is the importance of SSL?
Ans:
SSL keeps internet connections secure and prevents criminals from reading or modifying information transferred between two systems.

Q2) What is a SQL injection?
Ans:
SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.

Q3) What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?
Ans:
Cross-site scripting is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

Q4) Why shouldn't you roll your own crypto?
Ans:
Don't roll your own crypto, bro. In other words, don't try to write the encryption scheme used by your product to lock down files, conversations or anything else from the ground up, or even attempt to wildly customize an existing solution.

Q5) How are passwords stored on databases?
Ans:
The password entered by user is concatenated with a random generated salt as well as a static salt. The concatenated string is passed as the input of hashing function. The result obtained is stored in database.

Q6) What is a Man-in-the-middle attack?
Ans:
A man in the middle (MITM) attack is a general term for when a perpetrator positions himself in a conversation between a user and an application—either to eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway.

Q7) How do you safely manage environment variables in a cloud environment?
Ans:

Q8) How do you manage security updates?
Ans:

Q9) How do you keep encryption keys and credentials secure but make them available to machines that need them?
Ans:
Key management servers (KMS) are used to administer the full lifecycle of cryptographic keys and protect them from loss or misuse. KMS solutions, and other key management technology, ultimately control the generation, usage, storage, archival, and deletion of encryption keys.

Q1) What is docker for?
Ans:
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Q2) How to ask docker cli to show all containers?
Ans:
Using this commands --- docker container ls --- we see all containers

Q3) How to delete image with container, who use this image?
Ans:
Using this command --- docker rmi <ImageId> --- to delete the Docker Image

Q4) What command help you to delete all old unused images?
Ans:
Using this command --- docker image prune --- to delete all old unused images

Q5) What is docker-compose? What is docker-compose.yml?
Ans:
Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.
A docker-compose. yml is a config file for Docker Compose. It allows to deploy, combine, and configure multiple docker containers at the same time.

Q6) How to expose ports in docker-compose file?
Ans:
Ports mentioned in docker-compose. yml will be shared among different services started by the docker-compose. Ports will be exposed to the host machine to a random port or a given port.

Q7) How to reduce docker images?
Ans:
Using distroless/minimal base images
Multistage builds
Minimizing the number of layers
Understanding caching
Using Dockerignore
Keeping application data elsewhere

Q8) Where you can store docker images?
Ans:
Docker hub
Elastic container registry (ECR)

Q9) What is alpine and why we need it?
Ans:
From alpine description Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications.
